### Project Description
[Typing Ecosystem is a fun, interactive web app that visualizes your typing style by growing different creatures based on your speed, errors, and caps usage. It turns your typing behavior into a dynamic digital ecosystem with real-time stats and playful audio-visual feedback. ]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Typing can be boring and repetitive. Our app makes typing fun by growing cool creatures based on how you type ‚Äî speed, mistakes, and caps lock. It turns your everyday typing into a lively, colorful world!]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We watch how fast you type, how many mistakes you make, and when you smash that Caps Lock. Then‚Äîvoila!‚Äîwe magically grow little creatures that match your style. Fast? Fire spirits! Mistakes? Storm clouds! It‚Äôs like a tiny party on your screen every time you type!]
